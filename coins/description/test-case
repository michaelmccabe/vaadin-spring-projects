In England the currency is made up of pound, £, and pence, p, 

and there are eight coins in general circulation:
1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p) and £2 (200p).

Write a program that calculates the number of different ways £2 can be made using any number 
of coins 

 
As a pointer on what we would be looking for, if appropriate, in the app:
 
1. Clear separation of concerns
2. Well defined objects / interfaces
3. Application of good OO design principles to solve the problem
4. No code duplication
5. Test Driven Development
6. Well refactored code
7. Well tested code
